# 🩺 Sleep Apnea ECG Segmentation and Labelin

This repository contains my code and workflow for **preprocessing and visualizing ECG data** from the **St. Vincent's University Hospital / University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database**.  
I developed a robust preprocessing code that used Python, MNE, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to segment raw ECG recordings into 60-second windows, label them into **six apnea classes** and **one non-apnea class**, and visualize the segments for further machine learning tasks.

## 📌 **What this project does**

- 📥 Loads raw ECG `.edf` files using **MNE-Python**
- ⏱️ Segments each ECG recording into **60-second windows**
- 🏷️ Labels each segment into multiple apnea and non-apnea classes
- 📊 Visualizes the ECG signals and class distribution using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- ⚙️ Prepares clean, labeled data ready for training deep learning models (in TensorFlow or any framework)

Edit
jupyter notebook Sleep_Apnea_Preprocessing_Visualization.ipynb
4️⃣ Run the cells step-by-step to:

Load ECG data

Segment and label it

Visualize the signals and classes

📈 Purpose
This preprocessing and visualization pipeline supports automated sleep apnea detection research by producing clean, labeled ECG segments that can be used to train and evaluate classification models.
